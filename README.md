# FIRE FIRE, WALK WITH ME

This repository contains all the mini-games that have been developed by Mitchell Burns, Sofia Sukhova and Vlad Surdea-Hernea for the purpose of GRAD-E1326: Python Programming for Data Scientists class.

There are three separate mini-games that have been developed:

1. A trivia-game.
2. A text-based adventure game.
3. A "space invaders" like game, Falling Skies.

The three games open up separately, and can be played on all OSs. All mini-games have complete documentation and have been throughly commented for the benefits of both developers interested in this game, as well as the users.

As an extra-feature, we started developing a basic UI that would allow the users to choose which games to play at which time. While this is not part of the original proposal for the project, it will be developed by Mitchell Burns, Sofia Sukhova and Vlad Surdea-Hernea for future references (and for fun!). 

The playability of the games does not depend on installing specific software, and all the modules that have been used for developing the script are properly referenced.
