"""Falling Skies
The following script uses the turtle module in order to use basic graphics in Python, 
and the random module in order to make random numbers used for the dynamics of the game.

The game puts the player in the shoes of Agen Cooper that needs to avoid the poisonous
hazards droping from the sky, while also collecting the beneficial suitcases 
â€”proper for an FBI agent! 

"""

import turtle ### allows for basic graphics
import random ### will help us set some random elements for the game


######## PRE-GAME ###########
##############################

### Set up the number of lives and the initial score ###
score = 0
lives = 3


### Import "screen" and adjust settings ###
wn = turtle.Screen() # Create the gamescreen
wn.title("Falling Skies: Fire,Fire Walk with Me") # Add the title of the game
wn.bgpic("Back.gif") # Add the background for the screen
wn.setup(width=800, height=600) # Set the dimensions for the screen
wn.tracer(0) # Optimize drawings for MacOS


### Import pictures for character sprites ###
wn.register_shape("fbi.gif")  # Agen Cooper
wn.register_shape("poison.gif") # Hazards
wn.register_shape("rsz_suitcase.gif") # Benefits


### Create the player ###
player = turtle.Turtle() # import object
player.speed(0) # Set the animation speed
player.shape("fbi.gif") # Set the picture to be used for the sprire

player.penup() # Set player such as it won't draw

### Create list of benefits ###

### Create list of hazards ###

    bad_guy.speed = random.randint(1, 2) # Random speed b
    bad_guys.append(bad_guy) # Adding each good_guy to good_guys list

### Create scoreboard ###

pen.hideturtle() # Do not show the object
pen.speed(0) # Set speed
pen.shape("square") # Shape 
pen.color("white") # Color 
pen.penup() # Wont draw
